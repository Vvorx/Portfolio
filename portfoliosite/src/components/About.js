      <p>
      Hey there! I’m a second-year student at the University of Huddersfield, where I’m constantly exploring how technology can solve problems and make life a little easier. Whether it’s coding, tinkering with new tools, or just figuring out how to automate the small stuff, I love finding creative ways to use tech to simplify everyday tasks. <br />
      <br /> When I’m not buried in code or coursework, you’ll probably find me at the gym, reading a book or trying out some new tea.
      </p>
